        <p> I am a Digital Designer turned Developer, based out of Eastern, KY. In 2011, I began working in the creative field
          as a Graphic Designer. I picked up many valuable skills including a strong understanding of Layout, Typography
          and all of the software that goes along (Adobe Creative Suite). In my spare time, I also began building websites
          for clients. I came to enjoy web development so much that I started working as a developer full-time in 2016.
          The culmination of my creative and technical skills allow me to develop websites and mobile apps from start to
          finish.
